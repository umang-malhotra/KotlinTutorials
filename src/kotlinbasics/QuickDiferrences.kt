/***
1. Kotlin does not requires semicolon unlike Java

2. Kotlin has wrappers for some of the most used java methods, println is actually Java' System.out.println

3. Kotlin has the notion of Hard Keywords and soft Keywords, Hard keywords are just like java, in kotlin you can use soft keywords also

4. Kotlin writes more concise course, more in example

5. Kotlin has it's own String class,  You should take a look at String class, there are differences - https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/

6. Exceptions -> In java you have to declare if a function can throw a checked exception. In kotlin, it does not distinguish bw checked and unchecked exceptions
    Infact throw keyword does not exist in kotlin. In kotlin all exceptions are unchecked.

7. Ternary Operator -> ? does not exist in kotlin. It's replaced by if .  In kotlin if is an expression.

8. Original for loop doesn't exist in kotlin

9. kotlin does'nt have a static keyword. The concept of static is still there, It's syntactically not there.

10. There is no new Keyword in Kotlin. Because it's obvious to the compiler when you want to create a new instance of a class
